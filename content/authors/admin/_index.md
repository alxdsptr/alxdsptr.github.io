## About Me

I am a currently a second-year undergraduate student at the Department of Computer Sience and Electronic Engineering, Peking University. I have broad interests in computer graphics, ai, heterogeneous computing and even computational neuroscience. I'm still exploring and haven't decide what to do in the future.
